
PSN Finance offers a variety of personal loan products. Our interest rates start as low as 4.5% for qualified applicants and are fixed for the life of the loan. Loans can be used for debt consolidation, home improvements, or unexpected expenses.

To apply for a personal loan, you must be a resident of the United States, have a minimum credit score of 680, and have a verifiable annual income of at least $40,000. Our application process is fully online and takes less than 10 minutes to complete. We typically provide a decision within one business day.

We also offer home equity lines of credit (HELOCs) with variable interest rates. The HELOC rate is based on the prime rate plus a margin.
